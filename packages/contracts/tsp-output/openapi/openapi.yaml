        When a user has multiple roles, permissions are combined:
        - If ANY role denies an action, it is denied (deny wins)
        - If no role denies and ANY role allows, it is allowed
        - If no rules match, access is denied (default deny)

        Roles can be:
        - **Global roles**: App-scoped (tenantId is null), apply across all tenants
        - **Tenant roles**: Scoped to a specific organization

        Users can have multiple roles, and permissions are combined with
        deny-override semantics.
